## House Price Prediction Overview

This project utilizes a Neural Network implemented with TensorFlow to predict house prices. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features of houses such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc., along with their corresponding prices.

## Model Performance
MAE score of ~ 9000 on training set and ~16000 on test set 

## Installation

To run this house price prediction model, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if applicable)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib
